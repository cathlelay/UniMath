graphs
============

This directory contains a development of limits on the basis of descriptions of diagrams by graphs instead of functors.

* *colimits.v*
  * definition of graph and diagram
  * formalization of colimits on this basis
  * rules for pre- and post-composition
  * pointwise construction of colimits in functor precategories
  * left adjoints are co-continuous
  * closure properties of co-continuous functors
* *limits.v*
  * formalization of limits on the basis of graphs
  * pointwise construction of limits in functor precategories
  * alternative definition of limits via colimits
* *initial.v* --- definition as instance of colimit
